                I've separated my writing into two kinds. Most are not much more than fragments of thoughts,
                perhaps even inspired from only fleeting moments of enlightenment, and I've arranged these
                tweet-length aphoristic fragments in the appropriately titled "thoughts" page. My more cohesive
                writings, often not exceeding even 1000 words, are organized in the "blog" page. These are not
                exactly a typical essay, with no resounding conclusion, any standard of rigor or analysis, but
                rather a result of my indulgent practice of page vomiting. I do not quite possess the skills or
                experience required to tender my writing into something tidy and strict without having an aneurysm
                and beating my already delicate, neurotic mind. So, as to not inconvenience further, I have attached
                each essay and thought with as many tags as I see fit, which the dear reader can sort by and browse with.
            </p>

                Photography and film is my most recent interest. I have only even considered it a hobby of mine recently,
                so I have not quite put as much detail into the particulars of each photograph, as well as the cataloguing
                of these photographs. As to veer from the style of <i>lifestyle voyeurism</i>, I prefer to not photograph
                moments of profound emotion. I enjoy abstraction, still landscapes, and mundane human expression. Each
                photograph, like my writing, is tagged. Also like my writing, I have haphazardly thrown them in a gallery,
                which can be sorted by tags etc. Every photograph links to a unique page with further details, and
                photographs of food specifically link to its respective recipe, a complete catalogue of which is found
                in the page titled "recipes".
