                    <p>Extremely strange phenomena I’ve observed: When I want to make something really pretty and I care a lot about how it will look, I’ll give it a couple tries (e.g. I’ll write a word / take a picture / draw a doodle a couple of times and pick the best one) and very very often the first one is the best one. I think this is pretty absurd and interesting though I’d suspect it has more to do with cognitive biases than anything (devise an experiment!)</p>

                    <p>its very hard for me to have a strong opinion on some kinds of politics because my metaphysics simply accepts inequality as it is but morally I feel some kind of disgust for the way the world is and the way I consume things.

I also really want to hear what that slovenian lisp guy has to say about Armpit fetishes.

                    <p>If you have opened twitter in the last 7 days chances are you have stumbled upon THAT guy’s essay. I wrote a response to it (Title: You Cannot change your life in one day). But Its been like 3 weeks since Ive touched my blog and I&#x27;m too much of a lazy prick to do anything about it but I have so many new writings I’d like to share!</p>

                    <p>In a similar vein it seems that there is a personal spatial-temporal axis i.e. some people are very conscientious of the time it takes to do things while some are conscientious of the resources it takes to do things. I think maybe the most successful people are maximally temporal and minimally spatial</p>

                    <p>When comparing two things, finding the relationship between two things etc... especially for items of high dimensionality, the easiest way to gague how "good" or "close" etc. etc. two items are is to simply assign a boolean value on each dimension... One easy example: interpersonal compatibility. Two people are "closer" on this high dimensional space if some dimensions are close in value (if their difference in iq, personal interests = 0, they may get along well), and opposite for others (difference in disagreeableness = 1)... this model is very useful because 1. you are very stupid so you could not possibly project two things onto each other in a meaningful way and therefore this simplified model is a quick framework and 2. you should be very familiar with the things this is most useful for (i.e. you)</p>

                    <p>Very often, maybe once or twice a week, I’ll make an asinine complaint about whatever is bothering me (today it is how fucking moronic I think ap economics is), type something really long and post it on my instagram story and then remember this is not what my fans love me for so then i delete it.</p>

                    <p>I think love is one of those things that people desperately try to get right and they psychoanalyze themselves and their family and their husbands and wives and boyfriends girlfriends dog uncle sally gerbert to fucking Death and they ask themselves WHY and they read books about what it is supposed to look like and what they should do and who they should do When maybe. Whatever you already think love is is exactly what it is. And whatever you want to feel is exactly alright. No matter if people want to call it toxic or not.

i, 0, 1, gr, 2, e, 3, npi, 6, 7, 28, 42, 73, 6174, also any 2^n, or any autism primes.</p>

                    <p>Another thing I do rather often is create humungous universes of objects and states of affairs and characters based on very limited information. And so whatever happens in this universe is actually just a mess of compounded noise and looks absolutely nothing like reality. This has also made my life really bad (well. In a sort of horizontally caused way) because many times in my life some things would be okay but because of my schizoid simulations I just fucking brick myself and go crazy</p>

                    <p>A common therapy I enjoy is to think of the set of people better and worse than me. I.e. the set of people far more funny than me and then the set of people who are very boring (Indiscriminate in their relation to me because I am of course already very funny and interesting). I often fall into this status quo rationalization stage where somehow I decide that I am the perfect amount of funny and interesting without having to Shove myself down anyones throats. And I think this exercise has probably made my life worse in many many ways.</p>

Brother: One should never kill themselves

Me: But what if they suffer
B: They may find redemption

M: Think of a homeless man who can never escape addiction
B: But he can

M: Then shift the needle, imagine a man in a box, chained and whipped…

                    <p>Meditations on 2025

Do you believe in God?

I don’t want to believe in a world without magic

I want to be able to answer why with teleological conviction

Why was the last week of 2025 so… everything?

I don’t care what metaphysics led you to me

lets have a magical 2026

and live in the fantasy in our mind!</p>

                    <p>I find a lot of joy in being particularly cryptic in the intention of my messages… maybe not cryptic but layering irony in every word… Not even layering but plastering so thickly that nobody can tell if I mean X or not X… and actually to a point where I’m not even so sure what I mean. I think its my own kind of rebellion against words and people taking words so seriously when anyone can press any string of words for meaning and find whatever they want.

so its a bit of a little game for people to play And I relish seeing the reactions of people who dont know me so well and How they squirm in discomfort as they try to work out if i am a horrible person or not… I think it can be offputting to some people but I do it for ME

I tend to like people who can recognize it quicker than not I find that its a perfect test of intelligence and emotional awareness Well I wouldnt be so conclusive as to say people who recognize irony are more intelligent and more emotionally aware but they are surely moreso like me

and I think in a way I use irony as a kind of projection of my dialectic thoughts… i.e. I am mostly ambivalent not because of indecision but rather there is an ongoing conversation in my brain about something and therefore I say something that is true in one half of my brain and ironic in the other half of my brain

Let me know if you are like this as well and we can decide If we are psychopathic or not together</p>

                    <p>In the middle of the night IDK why but I just get random inspiration for fried chicken?

Things to test-

Steam breaded chicken to pregelatinize breading and then fry (I think I might be onto something) (I think this might also be the reason why doublefrying is so good) (also I suspect that chicken juices leak out during the frying process and so this will make a sealant kind of like a batter but unlike a batter it has surface texture)

Smashed wing salad? I watched like my 20th pierre koffman trotter video and it reminded me of deboning chicken wings with Ryan some random night after we built our stupid ass grill on the balcony… and how annoying it was… so I considered what it might be like removing the bones post cooking instead except that seems kind of gross? and kind of weird? But then I remembered some southeast asian dish where they smash fried chicken and smother it with sambal (probably malaysian) so maybe its not that weird. And everyone loves wings man except its so fucking annoying to eat. Sichuan chicken salad but wings holy fuck Need that rn</p>

                    <p>Niche sociology hypothesis: political ideology of big tech originating in sf is going to landslide to the right in n years.

Premise 1. Silicon valley is full of npc ass sniffer insecure nerds who will do anything for success (insane hivemind) (literally everuone thinks they are crazy except themselves) (they think they arent crazy enough)

Premise 2. Young men are ideological sheep

Premise 3. 99% of young entreprenurial men in SF is permastuck social climbing on twitter (far right brainrot cesspool) (imagine LA instagram models trying to collab except its computer nerds onntwitter)

Premise 4. Young entreprenurial men will spend their time on twitter interacting with far right fascists and view far right fascist propoganda because they are larpers and have nothing better to do

Conclusion: Silicon valley will quickly transform politically, elon musk will personally catalyze this event through his humungous levers (and already has been)</p>

                    <p>When I&#x27;m old enough and talented enough Yes I will spend my entire life cooking little aesthetic dishes okay. I will Actually care about how my food is arranged. Because my life will have then had no more left to offer and I will no longer have intrigue.</p>

                    <p>I’m really … kind of emotional. Actually. Like I would probably say I am a rather logical person but I think that is far from true. I think actually I would argue that 1. it is important to be quite emotional, and far more controversially, 2. value judgements cannot occur without emotions, therefore all moral agents must be emotional. Of course i know that when people characterize someone as “logical” they dont quite mean devoid of emotion but I would perhaps just prefer to point out that people are far more emotional than they think, insofar as every single instance of considering something to be good or bad is an emotional decision. And I have a lot of these kinds of opinions, even if its simply because I think about it often</p>

                    <p>I’ve always thought of bad things happening to me as a kind of self determining fatalist consequence of being a terrible human but I think it makes my life just so much more miserable. So now I’m going to start blaming everyone else and everything and the real telos of worldly punishment being that I am jesus and I am simply suffering for everyone elses mistakes. Maybe I will feel better about myself this way.</p>

                    <p>I always feel really uncomfortable hearing the word rape but in a literary sense I don&#x27;t feel that I should. Because words are simply words for the purpose of conveying greater meaning and any means to that end makes it better literature. And if it means to say what I mean I must say rape then so be it. I dislike this greatly about Americans and I have since found out that this is particular to a particularly reactionary and contextual and individual and subjectivist metacritical theories… a sort of anti realist position that I find to be absurd. Sort of even subverting rationalism entirely and entering a sort of aesthetic nihilism. where nothing is particularly correct except in that it is objective to the reader. In a similarly absurd way as is moral subjectivism.</p>

                    <p>Fucking hate the ideas that animals have moral worth relative to their sense of companionship. I’ve watched so many reels of dogs … forcfully copulating with other dogs and animals and inanimate objects … they are no more civilized and intelligent than pigs but we have no problem gassing 1.5billion pigs everyear… Disturbs me. Seriously. All this to say that dogs qualify for (some nonzero real value) moral value just as pigs and cows and chickens and humans do. Animal ethics and determinism are two such irrefutably “true” things it amazes me that probably 95% of people hold completely contradictory worldviews.</p>

                    <p>Context is such an important part of art…I think that in every part of human communication there is some amount of context that is to be had (i.e. empiricism)… at the very least in language there is the understanding of words and in art which is kind of a language there is the deciphering of visual elements… art is the aesthetic capturing of meaning and so naturally without the context of the experience or the context of the viewer (which are more similar than you may think) art cannot have meaning… and so it upsets me that some things are denied meaning because its context is stripped from it. Even for example if I’m me and I make a joke it would be more funny than if a comedian did because I’m such a dry boring guy that the context of me would make it funnier than if a funny guy you expect to be funny said it. Or if Hitler drew something it would be a more meaningful piece of art than if some random guy did because its something beautiful an ugly guy made. or if the Sistine Chapel ceiling was just in some dude’s bedroom… Yeah… Lmk if u agree</p>
