                    <p>Extremely strange phenomena I’ve observed: When I want to make something really pretty and I care a lot about how it will look, I’ll give it a couple tries (e.g. I’ll write a word / take a picture / draw a doodle a couple of times and pick the best one) and very very often the first one is the best one. I think this is pretty absurd and interesting though I’d suspect it has more to do with cognitive biases than anything (devise an experiment!)</p>

                    <p>The thing that Winesburg Ohio seems to be commentary about (even more than whatever the critics think, or at least what I’ve taken from it) is that every human deeply desires and needs something we could probably vaguely call “love”</p>

                    <p>its very hard for me to have a strong opinion on some kinds of politics because my metaphysics simply accepts inequality as it is but morally I feel some kind of disgust for the way the world is and the way I consume things. I just paid what is likely an undocumented hispanic migrant (half of my payment went to the expenses of the delivery logicstics company) to drive to a store and bring me an egregious amounts of caffienated beverages… the actual content of which accoumting for a small fraction of the cost (I am paying, in a way, for the dream of being Faker one day)</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the only important insight playing competitive video games can grant you is how fucking dogshit 99% of humans are at what they do. Even if its what they do their entire life. And almost everything falls into this pareto distribution of skill vs acclaim (aka rank).</p>

                    <p>Pioneering bedless meta. I think its kind of funny this bed-parts-shelf-thing looks like a throne theres probably some irony there. Also that it has literally zero integrity its just pieces of wood leaning against each other. Also the bible sits on The Throne probably some kind of commentary as well. I’m liking this setup because 1. there is finally space and 2. my window is no longer obstructed so I can hop in and out easily. Also I know why I’d never be an engineer because I&#x27;m stupid as fuck.</p>

                    <p>Crazy people will try to tell you that you actually NEED to read Hegel and Kant etc. etc. No actually I dont have a brain tumor I do not need another mental disorder. I DO NOT NEED to read the words they wrote. 

I also really want to hear what that slovenian lisp guy has to say about Armpit fetishes.

                    <p>If you have opened twitter in the last 7 days chances are you have stumbled upon THAT guy’s essay. I wrote a response to it (Title: You Cannot change your life in one day). But Its been like 3 weeks since Ive touched my blog and I&#x27;m too much of a lazy prick to do anything about it but I have so many new writings I’d like to share!</p>

                    <p>In a similar vein it seems that there is a personal spatial-temporal axis i.e. some people are very conscientious of the time it takes to do things while some are conscientious of the resources it takes to do things. I think maybe the most successful people are maximally temporal and minimally spatial</p>

                    <p>When comparing two things, finding the relationship between two things etc... especially for items of high dimensionality, the easiest way to gague how "good" or "close" etc. etc. two items are is to simply assign a boolean value on each dimension... One easy example: interpersonal compatibility. Two people are "closer" on this high dimensional space if some dimensions are close in value (if their difference in iq, personal interests = 0, they may get along well), and opposite for others (difference in disagreeableness = 1)... this model is very useful because 1. you are very stupid so you could not possibly project two things onto each other in a meaningful way and therefore this simplified model is a quick framework and 2. you should be very familiar with the things this is most useful for (i.e. you)</p>

                    <p>Very often, maybe once or twice a week, I’ll make an asinine complaint about whatever is bothering me (today it is how fucking moronic I think ap economics is), type something really long and post it on my instagram story and then remember this is not what my fans love me for so then i delete it.</p>

                    <p>I dont know if all of economics (and economists) is incredibly stupid or if I am just not perceptive enough But every single time I go to AP Economics I just cannot take it seriously. This is becoming a very serious problem for me because I’m now doubly unmotivated to study for my exam. I am just not very interested in the five hundred pieces of jargon used to express the same central Dogma that when things are more abundant people want it less. And also now I think that everyone who studies economics is a complete moron.</p>

                    <p>I think love is one of those things that people desperately try to get right and they psychoanalyze themselves and their family and their husbands and wives and boyfriends girlfriends dog uncle sally gerbert to fucking Death and they ask themselves WHY and they read books about what it is supposed to look like and what they should do and who they should do When maybe. Whatever you already think love is is exactly what it is. And whatever you want to feel is exactly alright. No matter if people want to call it toxic or not. Pinning this so I can laugh at myself in 10 years when I am a cynic divorcee.</p>

                    <p>Most reasonable choices for favourite numbers. Everything else is schizoid nonsense

i, 0, 1, gr, 2, e, 3, npi, 6, 7, 28, 42, 73, 6174, also any 2^n, or any autism primes.</p>

                    <p>Another thing I do rather often is create humungous universes of objects and states of affairs and characters based on very limited information. And so whatever happens in this universe is actually just a mess of compounded noise and looks absolutely nothing like reality. This has also made my life really bad (well. In a sort of horizontally caused way) because many times in my life some things would be okay but because of my schizoid simulations I just fucking brick myself and go crazy</p>

                    <p>A common therapy I enjoy is to think of the set of people better and worse than me. I.e. the set of people far more funny than me and then the set of people who are very boring (Indiscriminate in their relation to me because I am of course already very funny and interesting). I often fall into this status quo rationalization stage where somehow I decide that I am the perfect amount of funny and interesting without having to Shove myself down anyones throats. And I think this exercise has probably made my life worse in many many ways.</p>

                    <p>I liked the way you spoke. It reminded myself of me, if I were braver and sharper. If I didn't had to hide behind my small fences of irony.

Arent you the guy? With the Instagram stories? 

… 

Yeah you’re like an influencer. I love your Instagram man

🙂

I feel somehow both validated in that my slop at least entertains some people but also a bit sad my impression as a human is reduced to my instagram shitposting. Although most of my life is probably orthogonal to this guys Maybe I want to be known as the nonchalant intellectual chinese guy instead. I'm also practicing my sf goyim jargon (e.g. orthogonal isomorphic physiognomy etc.)</p>

                    <p>Meditations on 2025

Do you believe in God?

I don’t want to believe in a world without magic

I want to be able to answer why with teleological conviction

Why was the last week of 2025 so… everything?

I don’t care what metaphysics led you to me

lets have a magical 2026

and live in the fantasy in our mind!</p>

                    <p>I find a lot of joy in being particularly cryptic in the intention of my messages… maybe not cryptic but layering irony in every word… Not even layering but plastering so thickly that nobody can tell if I mean X or not X… and actually to a point where I’m not even so sure what I mean. I think its my own kind of rebellion against words and people taking words so seriously when anyone can press any string of words for meaning and find whatever they want.

so its a bit of a little game for people to play And I relish seeing the reactions of people who dont know me so well and How they squirm in discomfort as they try to work out if i am a horrible person or not… I think it can be offputting to some people but I do it for ME

I tend to like people who can recognize it quicker than not I find that its a perfect test of intelligence and emotional awareness Well I wouldnt be so conclusive as to say people who recognize irony are more intelligent and more emotionally aware but they are surely moreso like me

and I think in a way I use irony as a kind of projection of my dialectic thoughts… i.e. I am mostly ambivalent not because of indecision but rather there is an ongoing conversation in my brain about something and therefore I say something that is true in one half of my brain and ironic in the other half of my brain

Let me know if you are like this as well and we can decide If we are psychopathic or not together</p>

                    <p>In the middle of the night IDK why but I just get random inspiration for fried chicken?

Things to test-

Steam breaded chicken to pregelatinize breading and then fry (I think I might be onto something) (I think this might also be the reason why doublefrying is so good) (also I suspect that chicken juices leak out during the frying process and so this will make a sealant kind of like a batter but unlike a batter it has surface texture)

Smashed wing salad? I watched like my 20th pierre koffman trotter video and it reminded me of deboning chicken wings with Ryan some random night after we built our stupid ass grill on the balcony… and how annoying it was… so I considered what it might be like removing the bones post cooking instead except that seems kind of gross? and kind of weird? But then I remembered some southeast asian dish where they smash fried chicken and smother it with sambal (probably malaysian) so maybe its not that weird. And everyone loves wings man except its so fucking annoying to eat. Sichuan chicken salad but wings holy fuck Need that rn</p>

Ok. So the smartest math guys at my school people who I admire and look up to as like the smartest peopleI know got fucking fleeced by 12 year olds from a school That is like in my immediate vicinity Ok nice so I should fucking Die?

When does something go from not talking to talking and I dont mean in a pedantic pile of sand way but like actually the qualifications of talking. What the fuck? Am I going insane who are you guys talking to and what does that even mean??? Am I talking with anyone ?????? Or am I not. Who wants to be talk stagers?

                    <p>Actually I feel strongly about this notion of identity, being, etc. The thing I find the most contemptuous in the act of living is the yearning for some greater identity, and to ask yourself the worst question, who am I. I find the former an utter joke… to align yourself with some sects of other wandering apes… is to admit your worth not in terms of your whole but instead a fraction of what is a caricature of another. Simply being, one cannot contend with, but to advertise, to flaunt such properties, to be a mere “man” or “chinese” is to say, I am no more nuanced, unique, or individual than all of the rest of them. As wittgenstein says, that identity….. is not a relation between two items is obvious….. two terms plainly are not identical, and one term cannot be, for what is it identical with

And so naturally, one may ask then, what is such a relation, in its purpose for and otherwise, if not identity? To me, and to draw a simple answer to the latter idiocy, the answer is as plain and simple minded as those who choose to relate themselves as such: it is simply a costume of expression as to feel belonging socially, a crude biological instinct for survival, a sensus identitatis, to parody John Calvin’s sensus divinitatis. To wish to draw oneself in relation of others is driven either by complete ignorance of oneself or a pandering social performance for others. Either way, to obsess over such a labelling of self, which is nothing more than a referent, completely overlooks the formation of the ontological self. Such games of social circusing do not at all face the only important question in deciding that which exists in reality, what you think and what you do. To know who you are, ask only these simple questions, what do you want to do, and why? Higher order questioning will eventually lead to the set of truths in which ground your ontology, and thus, a sort of realist identity grounded in self.</p>

Some people live their whole life proving themselves and it is so tiring I will not prove myself to colleges I will not prove myself to employers and I will definitelt not prove myself to you. Because I dont care what you think. I dont need to know who I am because I simply am, and any higher level thought is simply a distraction away from yourself</p>

Men shrug their shoulders upwards and outwards to display their pelvis (masculine = penis) and chest while women shrug their shoulders downwards and inwards to display their… mating readiness (hips and butt and breast)

Maybe this is crude and surfacd analysis but I think I’m onto something.</p>

                    <p>Reasons why (nobody cares)

- I like dieting unironically (both ways) 
- I dont have an eating disorder
- I really liked peter singer’s book Animal liberation (or at least around 60 pages and about 2 podcast episodes worth of book)
- I like doing hard things
- I’m getting too fat
- I think it will improve my mood
- I want to explore vegan cooking
- I want to see if I think practically veganism is a good choice for people, and why I disagree with Singer’s arguments</p>

                    <p>Learned a new chinese word 奶0

Means milk zero.

Milk cuz cute young boys have light milky skin and youthtful infantile features

the chinese have an excellent system to label the gays. 0 for bottoms and 1 for tops. its a photosemantic kind of system.

I’m sure its not hard to extrapolate what this means</p>

                    <p>Niche sociology hypothesis: political ideology of big tech originating in sf is going to landslide to the right in n years.

Premise 1. Silicon valley is full of npc ass sniffer insecure nerds who will do anything for success (insane hivemind) (literally everuone thinks they are crazy except themselves) (they think they arent crazy enough)

Premise 2. Young men are ideological sheep

Premise 3. 99% of young entreprenurial men in SF is permastuck social climbing on twitter (far right brainrot cesspool) (imagine LA instagram models trying to collab except its computer nerds onntwitter)

Premise 4. Young entreprenurial men will spend their time on twitter interacting with far right fascists and view far right fascist propoganda because they are larpers and have nothing better to do

Conclusion: Silicon valley will quickly transform politically, elon musk will personally catalyze this event through his humungous levers (and already has been)</p>

                    <p>I fucking love Christian lore so much it is so weird and cool and kind of horrible. And interesting. I’m just starting Exodus but man Genesis is such a doozy here sre my favourite quotes so far from genesis 

“Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren” Guy and his entire fucking bloodline gets enslaved (lol)

“One day the older daughter said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children… Let’s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father. That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “last night I slept with my father. lets get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.” So thwy got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.”

What the fuck???? this guys fucking daughters literally drug and rape their father???? and birth 2 children??? what the fuck?????</p>

                    <p>I’m really … kind of emotional. Actually. Like I would probably say I am a rather logical person but I think that is far from true. I think actually I would argue that 1. it is important to be quite emotional, and far more controversially, 2. value judgements cannot occur without emotions, therefore all moral agents must be emotional. Of course i know that when people characterize someone as “logical” they dont quite mean devoid of emotion but I would perhaps just prefer to point out that people are far more emotional than they think, insofar as every single instance of considering something to be good or bad is an emotional decision. And I have a lot of these kinds of opinions, even if its simply because I think about it often</p>

                    <p>I’ve always thought of bad things happening to me as a kind of self determining fatalist consequence of being a terrible human but I think it makes my life just so much more miserable. So now I’m going to start blaming everyone else and everything and the real telos of worldly punishment being that I am jesus and I am simply suffering for everyone elses mistakes. Maybe I will feel better about myself this way.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately every single macro description of the world is wrong. And the only way to truly understand anything is to look Really. Really. Really. Closely. Newtonian mechanics are really just quantum mechanics at a scale without wavelength interference. Macroeconomics is the aggregate of individual choice etc. etc. but you can’t truly understand how a ball falls or why the market moves without first understanding what jimmyjohn from north dakota knows and thinks and desires or how a singular atom behaves. it’s not even about reconciling these two lenses but at least. Being able to make inferences with scale. Thats what I hate the most about anything to do with humans especially. Like history politics sociology economics psychology religion philosophy whatever it is. Macro lenses blur the ultimate motivation for all human activity… desire for… whatever it may be. It’s frustrating to learn things at such a scale and neglect the jarring imperfections we are too embarrassed to admit to. And I think this is the ultimate paradox of democracy, that individual choice MATTERS, but in that each desire is dangerously fallable and malleable. by understanding individuals. we can be turned into groups, and that is when we lose any semblance of autonomy</p>

                    <p>Really funny quotes from the wikipedia entry about the wittgenstein family (The one with Ludwig) Honestly they are so funny and amazing in a really sort of disturbing morbid way. I really must share them.

From Paul to a young Ludwig, while practicing the piano: “I cannot play when you are in the house, as I feel your skepticism seeping towards me from under the door!” 

“I ought to have ... become a star in the sky. Instead of which I have remained stuck on earth.”

Anyways three of five brothers committed suicide. The Wittgensteins were the second richest family in europe, only behind the Rothschilds, who were also Jewish. Not saying theres a pattern or anything.</p>

Ans like Peter Thiel documentaries. Anyways theres this one person I know theyre always like Omg I hate Israel I hate palantir!!! I&#x27;m pro marxist!!! and then when at all engaged with any meaningful question about literally anything adjacent they have 0 idea about anything. This is a lot of people. And At least I wont pretend to know. This is why I hate criticism.</p>

                    <p>Well at least for me I would imagine that the reason why liking someone particularly is so painful that I actively avoid liking anyone to any extent… would be probably something like an external manefestation of my personal inadequacy. Me not feeling deserving of liking people. But who fucking cares about me. Anyways from my notes app these are the people I liked in my life. A bit embarassing but when I was 13 years old or something in middle school I really liked this one girl I was very close with and then One random day I told her over discord and I was so embarrassed I never felt the same again. Andthat was particularly terrible. The rest are a bit self explanatory. I would say I was only particularly infatuated with in my life was my middle school friend and since then everyone else that I’ve liked was in a sort of doting idolizing way that wasnt really … romantic and moreso an aesthetic fantasy. Keen leon zhou fans will notice the intentional omission of a certain person but. It’s also important to note that even throughout our relationship I would seriously consider categorizing her rather as an aesthetic fantasy than a helpless infatuation in that fairy tale sense.</p>

                    <p>Thinking about crushes right now. Not sure why they are so disgusting and awful. I sort of pity psychologists. I almost feel like psychology is… wrong. Maybe not wrong but it’s difficult for me to imagine any sort of unifying psychological theories that explain anything that isnt particularly obvious in a way that is satisfying.</p>

Fuck my chungus life. Why do they keep ruining social media? I just want a void to scream into that isnt going to ejaculate white supremacist maga ragebait back at me. I fucking miss twitter man but it is just so disgusting And this app sucks too I am playing instagram reels dodging simulator I am too disgustingly monkeybrained I cannot help myself to Instagram droolfeed sometimes. So I have to save my ideas somewhere and write about it later and it ruins the funnyness and spontaneity and thrill of it. And I&#x27;m reading my notepad back at myself and I&#x27;m like Damn this guy really wanted to say this shit Like yes I feel this way all the time when I read my Instagram Stories back at myself.</p>

                    <p>I always feel really uncomfortable hearing the word rape but in a literary sense I don&#x27;t feel that I should. Because words are simply words for the purpose of conveying greater meaning and any means to that end makes it better literature. And if it means to say what I mean I must say rape then so be it. I dislike this greatly about Americans and I have since found out that this is particular to a particularly reactionary and contextual and individual and subjectivist metacritical theories… a sort of anti realist position that I find to be absurd. Sort of even subverting rationalism entirely and entering a sort of aesthetic nihilism. where nothing is particularly correct except in that it is objective to the reader. In a similarly absurd way as is moral subjectivism.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately recently my life has been consumed by the philosophy of religion. It is so incredibly pointless to care about religion and the truth of God and theology (because it is almost certainly false). I’ve been sucked so far deep into this dumb pointless hole I dont know what to do with my life anymore. It’s not even like I question God I just find it fascinating to learn about.</p>

                    <p>Does anyone notice the inflection point in this societal libertarian movement? Like we no longer care about stripping identity and values from attributes. E.g. “wokeism” saying anyone can be X and have long hair etc. Especially in lgbt communities? I dont like the term woke but I’ll use it here… but it seems the “woke movement” has been sort of culturally rejected in that things like being a certain way once again requires a certain type of identity. But in like 2017-2022 it felt like anyone could be anything as long as its self determined 

I FEEL STRONGLY THIS WAY ABOUT THE LABEL OF PERFORMATIVE. I KNOW IT SEEMS SELF INCRIMINATING TO SAY THIS. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I’VE BEEN DRINKING MATCHA AND LISTENING TO CLAIRO SINCE LIKE FOREVER. But. I actually feel like its sort of once again tying certain stereotypes back to whatever orentational or gender identity which i think is bad. 

I HATE that ANTIWOKETRUMP is winning but st the same time I do think it went too far. I dont deny the sociological psychological evolutionary truths of identity but also I hope as a society we can do more to accept and encourage a diverse and inclusive development of This one needs its own thing:</p>

“[on a christian worldview] a serial killer who spent his life killing and raping children need only come to God on death row and after a final meal of fried chicken to spend an eternity in heaven” - Sam Harris. I love watching these 2005 debates because this is clearly a … racially motivated statement

What are reasonable presuppositions to make when devising thought experiments? I have an emotional quarrel with Sam Harris’ Greatest suffering model but i cant quite describe it

Does anyone like William Craig? I actually think hes brilliant. I dont respect any Christian more than him and I love his pompous voice and how sharp and concise he is. Seriously one of my idols in theology.

I wonder who the best person from niche countries are. Like who is the best ever moldovan. Or the best ever scot? Well it’s probably adam smith or David Hume. Actually scotland has made some really cool people.

Smart people believe in stupid things all the time man.

I wish I liked being with people it would make having friends much easier. And making friends.</p>

                    <p>Fucking hate the ideas that animals have moral worth relative to their sense of companionship. I’ve watched so many reels of dogs … forcfully copulating with other dogs and animals and inanimate objects … they are no more civilized and intelligent than pigs but we have no problem gassing 1.5billion pigs everyear… Disturbs me. Seriously. All this to say that dogs qualify for (some nonzero real value) moral value just as pigs and cows and chickens and humans do. Animal ethics and determinism are two such irrefutably “true” things it amazes me that probably 95% of people hold completely contradictory worldviews.</p>

                    <p>Getting tired of the “it was promised to them” punchline making fun of Jewish people. And I dislike Israel and hate religious fundamentalism as much as people reasonably do. But well first of all it’s getting boring and overused and 80% of being funny is being unexpected. Also if you want to make fun of fundamentalists why dont we going around making fun of christian fundamentalists and leviticus or the slaughter of amalekites or midianites and say idk “God instructed them to kill every man woman child and animal! lol!”. Anyways I think we’re getting too comfortable with being anti jew. I still hate alex karp and genocidal oligarchs but some jews are chill bro</p>

                    <p>How to do nihilism. 

Step 1: Empistemological nihilism. First acknowledge no knowledge is certain.

Step 2: Moral nihilism. Naturally then infer that nothing can be good nor bad objectively and everything that is described as good or bad morally is just aesthetics.

Step 3: There does not exist free will, and so moral responsibility, objective or not, can be assigned personally

Step 4: Postulate that since you know nothing and nothing is good or bad and you arent responsible for doing good or bad things then therefore it doesnt matter what you strive to do. Therefore the only thing that matters is that you do things you desire

Step 5: Enjoy your life without worrying about things that you dont care about</p>

                    <p>Ok some of my thoughts I am recollecting them.

GUI (pronounced gooey) as instagrammable/aesthetic packaging

Trends within arts as influenced by tech:

1. Instant capturing of aesthetic
2. Broader mainstream appeal
3. Hatred amongst early adopters 
4. AI is a massive threat to the status quo of the arts, in a much more macro level, but not as damaging as people think, or at least in a different way
5. Pop art is cooked (it’s always cooked)
6. Pinterest will mark this trend of AI in the arts

Seems like its really easy to market dating apps

Vertical LLM wrapper agent b2b saas is Not The Future (needs some kind of local integrability).

Consumer is unironically undervalued (ai consumer sucks rn)

                    <p>Qualitative analysis of proprietary Stevenson hot sauces mixed with honey</p>
                    <p>Methodology and results:

15cc of each hot sauce (L to R: Tabasco, Cholula, The Pepper Plant, Sriracha) mixed with 15cc of honey, dipped into and tested with sliced english cucumbers (Cucumis sativus)

Each sample is reviewed on it’s taste, consistency and spice to sweetness ratio. A general score is given, considering each of these variables.

Tabasco: Very spicy. The acid of the Louisiana vinegar based hot sauces overwhelms the flavor of the honey. Not balanced at all. The sauce is very runny. Poor flavor, and the one-dimensionality of Tabasco does not shine here. Score: 2.0/10.0

Cholula: Well balanced sweetness and spice. The distinct smoky flavor of this hot sauce pairs well with honey. The consistency of this sauce is excellent, holding a thick, luscious, glazed texture.  Score: 8.8/10.0

The Pepper Plant: Very sweet honey forward. A very flavorful, unique hot sauce. Very interesting, well balanced notes of spice and acidity. This has the best flavor, but it looks like vomit and isnt’t very spicy. It retains the consistency of honey. Score: 8.6/10.0

Sriracha: So bad. Only tastes like garlic. Super awful fbaor. This brand of sriracha sucks but its probably simolar  enough to predict the original one. The sonsistenxy is nice. Flavor is so bad. Score: 2.2/10.0</p>
                 <p>Conclusion:

Honey combines well with milder sauces with low acidity and fresh flavors. Sauces with overly acidic profiles or low quality flavors will not combine well with honey. This condiment is an excellent pairing on sandwiches and cucumbers alike. Personally, I’m excited to test this new idea on a tomato sandwich once Stevenson brings back tomatos.

                    <p>I forgot 😭 sorry… this is the most important one because it’s like THE face emoji for young people. I’m not really a fan because it’s used in a way thats almost entirely reactionary and I don’t like that. And in the cases where it isn’t it simply conveys a magnitude of expression that is nearly never genuine to my true feelings. So it’s B tier as a benchmark emoji and it’s popularity</p>

                    <p>Context is such an important part of art…I think that in every part of human communication there is some amount of context that is to be had (i.e. empiricism)… at the very least in language there is the understanding of words and in art which is kind of a language there is the deciphering of visual elements… art is the aesthetic capturing of meaning and so naturally without the context of the experience or the context of the viewer (which are more similar than you may think) art cannot have meaning… and so it upsets me that some things are denied meaning because its context is stripped from it. Even for example if I’m me and I make a joke it would be more funny than if a comedian did because I’m such a dry boring guy that the context of me would make it funnier than if a funny guy you expect to be funny said it. Or if Hitler drew something it would be a more meaningful piece of art than if some random guy did because its something beautiful an ugly guy made. or if the Sistine Chapel ceiling was just in some dude’s bedroom… Yeah… Lmk if u agree</p>

                    <p>Hypothesis older people are more emotive because young people are bombarded with so much data that they have learned to process information more logically to seperate truth from garbage (influence of media and internet) Also social factors definitely matter… but maybe older people experience more empathy</p>
